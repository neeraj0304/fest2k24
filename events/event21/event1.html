                2.	In case of a tie, an extra time of 90 seconds will be 
                given, the winner will be the one who first scores a goal. If no one scores a goal, another tie breaker of 90 seconds will be held. Still if no one scores, the team with more negative points will lose.<br><br>
                3.	Match will start from the center of the field with the 
                plastic ball kept in the red circle.<br><br>
                4.	A goal will be considered only if the ball crosses the                 
                goal line completely.
                
                </p><br>
  




            <p><h3> Fouls and Penalties:  </h3><br>
              1.	Any kind of intentional damage to the opponent bot(s) 
will be considered as a foul.<br><br>
2.	Teams have to take care of their wirings. The wirings
should be at the height of at least 30cms from the game field. Wirings shouldn't touch the game field. If any team tries to disturb the game intentionally using wires or if wires are in contact with the arena for 5 seconds continuously penalty of -2 points will be given, and the opponent gets the ball and the game is continued from the same position.<br><br>
3.	None of the bots should grab the ball and hold it for
 more than 5secs. If it holds more than the prescribed time ball a penalty of -5 will be awarded, and the ball will be passed to opponent team and game restarts from center.
