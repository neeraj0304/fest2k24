          <h2>RULES:</h2><br>
          <li>REGISTRATION FEE:400 &#8377; per team</li><br>

          <h3>Problem statement:</h3><br>
          
            <p>The challenge is to create a robot (manually controlled / autonomous) whose sole purpose is to immobilize or otherwise move your opponent out of the arena within a stipulated time. This event aims to test your Robot against another in a field of combat where brute strength and cat-like reflexes hold the key to success.</p><br>
          
            <h3>Specifications:</h3><br>
            <li> Team size is at max 3.</li>
            <br>
            <li> BOT SPECIFICATIONS: The bot should not exceed the 
              dimension 400mm x 400mm at any point during the 
               match.
          </li>
            <br>
            <li> All robots must have easily visibility and controlled mobility 
              in order to compete.
          </li>
            <br>
            <li> Weight of bot should not exceed 10kg (including all 
              accessories).
          </li>
            <br>
          
            <h3>Methods of mobility include:</h3><br>
            <li> Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot).</li><br>
            <li>Walking (linear actuated legs with no rolling or cam  
              operated motion).
           </li><br>
            <li> Ground effect air cushions (hovercrafts)</li>
            <br>
              
            <p>NOTE: Hammers, Drums and other stuff is allowed. IC engines, 
              Inflammable, chemical, and explosive weapons should not be 
              Used Cutters and other sharp devices are allowed.
          </p><br>

          
            <h3>Control Requirements:</h3>
            <br>
            

            <p>1. Bot can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. <br> <br>
              2. In case of wired bot, wires should be stacked into a single 
                         unit and should be slack at every moment of the competition. <br><br>
                     3.All the robots with wireless control should be able to change
                    frequencies (if required) or coded channels to prevent any radio 
                    conflicts, it may be changed before the start of the match to avoid   
                    frequency interference with other teams. <br><br>
                     4. Remote controls available in market can also be used.
                         Power Source: <br><br>
                     5. Batteries, if used, should not be damaged and non-leak proof as it     
                          may lead to disqualification. <br><br>
                     6. Special care should be taken for protecting the on-board batteries                
                         You wont be allowed to change batteries during the match. <br><br>
                     7. It is suggested to have extra battery ready and charged up during 
                        competition so that the team, on advancing to next level, have their
                        robots ready on time. <br><br>
                     8. The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in 
                        any form is not allowed. <br><br>
              </p>
             <h3>Pneumatics:</h3><br>

             <p>1.	Robot can use pneumatic devices actuated by pressurized non- 
             inflammable gases. Maximum allowed outlet nozzle pressure is 8 bar. <br><br>
             2.	The maximum pressure in cylinder should not exceed the rated 
             pressure at any point of time.<br> <br>
             3.	Entire pneumatic setup should be on-board, no external input 
             (from outside the arena) can be given to the robot for functioning of its pneumatic system.<br> <br>
            </p><br>


            <h3>Gameplay:</h3><br>

            <p>          1. A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized. <br><br>
              2. A robot will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion 
                  of at least two inches in a timed period of 30 seconds. <br><br>
              3. In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round 
                  then the winner will be decided based on the points (criteria for 
                  points allocation is mentioned below). <br><br>
                        4. The game will consist of 2 rounds of 3 min each and each
                            subsequent round will have a time gap of 1 min.<br><br>
              5. If a robot is thrown out of the arena, that particular round will  
                            stop immediately, and the robot still inside the arena will      
                            automatically be declared as the winner of that round and other 
                  rounds will continue as usual.<br><br>
               6. Robots cannot win by merely lifting their opponents. Organizers
                   will allow lifting for a maximum of 20 seconds for each lift and the the
                   attacker robot will be instructed to release the opponent. If, after being
                   instructed to do so, the attacker is unable to release, they will be 
                   awarded -10 points.<br><br>
              7. If two or more robots become entangled due to any reason and becomes
                  trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the 
                  timekeeper aware and the fight should be stopped and the robots should
                  be separated by the safest means.<br><br>
              8.Technical hold will be given for 15 seconds with request of the participant
                  and leads to penalty of -5 points.<br><br>
              9. Points will be given on the basis of attack.<br><br>
              Aggression and attack:
                          Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity,
                          boldness and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the 
                          robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally 
                         attacked an opponent or if the attack doesnâ€™t have any impact on the 
                         enemy bot, that act will not be considered Aggression. For every
                         attack, the bot will be given 10 points. Once a round is finished, 
                         whichever bot, the organizers Fee l is aggressive in that particular
                         round, that bot is given 30 points.
              10. As shown in the given arena, during game process if opponent falls in
                    the hole provided in the arena due to the strike of the attacker, the
                    attacker is awarded 10 points<br><br>
              </p><br>
           
           <h3>NOTE:</h3><br>
             <p>
              1.	A robot that is unsafe, as deemed by the judges, will be disqualified<br><br>
2.	 Immediately and the opponent robot will be declared as the
 winner.<br><br>
3.	The bot is not allowed to leave anything behind during the run. It
 should not leave any mark on the arena. Any bot found damaging
 the arena will be immediately disqualified.<br><br>
4.	If there is any kind of ambiguity in selection of weapon systems,
please clarify the same with the event organizers to avoid further confusion.<br><br>
               Any further requests will be considered during the game.<br>
